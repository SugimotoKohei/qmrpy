## 1. qMRLab

- Upstream: <https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab>
- Copyright (c) 2017 NeuroPoly
- Licence: MIT License (repository `LICENSE`)

The following modules are Python translations of qMRLab MATLAB functions. **All of the
corresponding upstream files live under qMRLab's `src/` tree and are therefore covered
by qMRLab's MIT licence.** No code from qMRLab's `External/` tree — which bundles
third-party software under separate, sometimes non-permissive terms — is used.

| qmrpy module | qMRLab source |
|---|---|
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/split_bregman.py` | `src/Models_Functions/QSM/qsmSplitBregman.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/sharp.py` | `src/Models_Functions/QSM/backgroundRemovalSharp.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/gradient_mask.py` | `src/Models_Functions/QSM/calcGradientMaskFromMagnitudeImage.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/unwrap.py` | `src/Models_Functions/QSM/unwrapPhaseLaplacian.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/utils.py` | `src/Models_Functions/QSM/calcFdr.m`, `kspaceKernel.m`, `applyForward.m`, `calcChiL2.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/qsm/pipeline.py` | `src/Models/QSM/qsm_sb.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/t2/mwf.py` | `src/Models_Functions/MWF/met2_eva/do_regNNLS.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/t1/vfa_t1.py` | `src/Models/T1_relaxometry/vfa_t1.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/t1/inversion_recovery.py` | `src/Models/T1_relaxometry/inversion_recovery.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/b1/dam.py` | `src/Models/FieldMaps/b1_dam.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/b1/afi.py` | `src/Models/FieldMaps/b1_afi.m` |
| `qmrpy/models/t2/mono_t2.py` | `src/Models/T2_relaxometry/mono_t2.m` |
| `qmrpy/sim/simulation.py` | qMRLab `SingleVoxel` / `SimVary` / `SimRnd` / `SimFisherMatrix` addons |

### Upstream attribution recorded by qMRLab for the QSM functions

The qMRLab QSM sources listed above state in their own headers that they were
refactored from Berkin Bilgic's scripts (original source:
`https://martinos.org/~berkin/software.html`), with the original reference:

> Bilgic B, Fan AP, Polimeni JR, et al. Fast quantitative susceptibility mapping with
> L1-regularization and automatic parameter selection. *Magn Reson Med.*
> 2014;72(5):1444-1459. doi:10.1002/mrm.25029

qmrpy's QSM modules are therefore attributed to both qMRLab and that upstream work.

## 2. DECAES.jl

- Upstream: <https://github.com/jondeuce/DECAES.jl>
- Copyright (c) 2019 Jonathan Doucette
- Licence: MIT License

The following modules are Python translations of DECAES.jl:

| qmrpy module | DECAES.jl source |
|---|---|
| `qmrpy/_decaes/nnls.py` | `src/NNLS.jl` (`unsafe_nnls!`, Householder helpers, Tikhonov variant) |
| `qmrpy/_decaes/surrogate_1d.py` | `src/NNLSRegularization.jl` (`CubicHermiteInterpolator`, `surrogate_spline_opt`) |
| `qmrpy/epg/core.py`, `qmrpy/models/t2/decaes_t2*.py` | `src/EPGdecaycurve.jl` (`epg_decay_curve!`, element flip matrix) |
| `qmrpy/models/t2/decaes_t2part.py` | `src/T2partSEcorr.jl` (`sigmoid_weights`, T2-parts analysis) |

`tests/data/decaes_ref*.csv` are **numerical outputs** produced by running DECAES.jl,
used as fixed reference vectors for parity testing. They contain no DECAES source code.

## 3. MRzeroCore (optional dependency, AGPL-3.0)

- Upstream: <https://github.com/MRsources/MRzero-Core>
- Licence: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

`qmrpy/sim/mrzero.py` calls MRzeroCore through a lazy import. **No MRzeroCore code is
copied into qmrpy.** Because AGPL-3.0 imposes copyleft (including its network-use
provision in section 13) on works combined with it, MRzeroCore is **not** a default
dependency. It is installed only via the opt-in extra:

```bash
pip install "qmrpy[mrzero]"
```

Users who install that extra should be aware that the resulting combined environment is
subject to the AGPL-3.0 terms. All other qmrpy functionality works without it.

---

## 4. Runtime dependency licences

Installed by default:

| Package | Licence |
|---|---|
| joblib | BSD-3-Clause |
| numpy | BSD-3-Clause (with 0BSD / MIT / Zlib / CC0-1.0 components) |
| pillow | MIT-CMU |
| pypulseq | MIT |
| scipy | BSD-3-Clause |
| tqdm | MPL-2.0 AND MIT |

Optional extras:

| Extra | Package | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `io` | nibabel | MIT |
| `io` | pydicom | MIT |
| `viz` | pandas | BSD-3-Clause |
| `viz` | plotnine | MIT |
| `mrzero` | mrzerocore | **AGPL-3.0** |

None of these packages are bundled; they are resolved by the package manager at install
time and remain under their own licences.

---

## 5. Removed components

`MPPCA` (Marchenko-Pastur PCA denoising) was removed in the release following 1.1.0.
Its implementation had been translated from `MPdenoising.m`, which qMRLab ships under
`External/mppca_denoise/` and which is **not** covered by qMRLab's MIT licence. That
file (Copyright (c) 2016 New York University and University of Antwerp, author Jelle
Veraart) grants rights only to non-commercial entities, only for non-commercial
research, and only to "use, copy and modify" — it does not grant redistribution or
sublicensing rights. Redistributing a translation of it under the MIT License would
have exceeded the granted rights, so the component was removed rather than relicensed.

Users who need MP-PCA denoising should obtain it directly from a source whose licence
permits their intended use.
